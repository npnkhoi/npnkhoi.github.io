been to a sunday meditation.

the talk was about self. The notion of the separate self is not natural. [Victor of Aveyron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_of_Aveyron).

The notion of self is supposed to be a productive concept by nurture. By seeing
oneself as separate, there might be some evolutionary advantage. If you care
more about yourself, then it is more likely that you will self-preserve.
Consequently, you and your species will likely to survive long into the future.
By the case of [Victor of Aveyron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_of_Aveyron), a well-documented feral child (a child
growing up in the forest) in the 18th century.

smell: the universe through the lens of a dog. In the human culture, smelling
other people is an intimate act. That is partly because we have very weak
olfaction. Therefore, we only smell other people when we have physically close.
So smelling is usually an act in very close relationships -- romantic partners,
parents and children, siblings, etc. But it is not necessarily the reality.
Dogs use smells extensively to navigate the world. In fact, [dogs perceive time
via smell](https://www.petmd.com/dog/behavior/do-dogs-have-sense-time)[^1]. So, in
this example, the way humans perceive the world through sense is fundamentally
cultural, as another species uses that sense completely differently. Therefore,
it is very relative to think the reality we are perceiving.

[^1]: There is a book that seems to be seminal in our understanding of dog's
  perception, call [**Being a Dog: Following the Dog Into a World of Smell**](https://alexandrahorowitz.net/Being-a-Dog) by Alexandra Horowitz.
