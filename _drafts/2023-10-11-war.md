[Podcast: Lex Fridman interviewing Jared Kushner (former US presidential advisor) on the current Israel - Palestine conflict](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lex-fridman-podcast/id1434243584?i=1000631007333)

- I wanted to cry for the turmoil of conflicts in Israel and Gaza. The sad void of Jared triggers it all.
- BB sounds like a strong leader. But as Jared said, he is *sitting in the fog of war*. His mind must be wanting to explode to see citizens being killed, while holding military in hand, having connections with the most powerful states in the world, but afraid to harm more innocent lives.
