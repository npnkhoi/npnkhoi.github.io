About the AES survey of Shengjie and thay at EMNLP 2024. It is an instance
where simple things can be gems. I am aware of AES, but I have not looked into
it seriously. Shengjie is my close friend in the lab, but I have never read his
AES work in their entirety. Now I do, and his survey is really good.

Motivation for AES. There are too many essays to grade, in many languages.
There are a lot of regularities (i.e., patterns in the grading process). And Machine Learning is very good at
automating the regularities.

Organization of the paper. They start with telling the history, then critique
multiple parts of it. They set the premise of their critique as "optimizing for
the higher performance measure is not healthy". Then in the meat of the paper,
they go to each aspect of the body of work and offer their critique. They are
very consistent with their narrative. For each aspect, they highlight the
status quo and reveal the prolematic. After that, they explicitly present their
recommendation and even number them throughout the paper.
