## The scene

Playing ultimate in the snow on the first day.
Laying out seems so easy. We slide seamlessly.

Playing on actual ice on the second day. It is actually dangerous to play. We
warm up slowly. Almost everyone just make tiny running steps on ice.
Different teams have different ways to deal with it. Most teams seem to cancle
the first match in the morning. UTD and Kansas State chose to divide the field
into three and play 3v3 minis with each other. On the field next to us, there
was an even funner game -- walking ultimate. The rule is simple -- play as in
ultimate except that no one can run. The game there was great to watch, mostly
due to the sideline energy. Players on the sideline of both teams cheer their
walking teammates passionately. Their passion is much higher than that of
a normally ruled ultimate match. Every successful throw and catch was cheered
x3 normally to appreciate the lack of running in doing so. People weren't
running deep anymore, but "walking deep" in a hugely hyped encouragement from
the audience. There was an overthrown huck to the endzone, and the cutter
decided to run. The sideline crowd raised their voice even louder, hilariously
objecting the runner. When they caught the disc and scored, countless boos were
given to him. Such a bad player!

## UTD performance



## On the road

We drove 4.5 hours from Dallas to Tulsa for the tournament. It was a long ride
through not only highways but also tiny roads. Vast rural fields moved backwards on both sides of our car. Here, houses are extremely distant from each other, whereby the distance from any two consecutive houses are at least 100 meters. I can't imagine living such a life. Moving from the close-knit setting of Vietnam to the out-spread of Dallas was already a challenge for me. This is too extreme.
