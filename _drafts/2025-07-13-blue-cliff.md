### First day?
- Road to Blue Cliff: beautiful for a bit, but dangerous overall
- Chi Hai Ly (and saw Quynh Chi and My Chau without talking to them)
- a weed wacking car
- setting up the tent that Stefan lent me
- Dinner at Brother's side: met Bill, Madday; saw thay Dai Luc; met thay Phap Thuat (from Nha Trang for a bit, warm voice)
- Orientation: unskillful speaker, but saw Mai, and saw Quynh Chi sitting next to me
