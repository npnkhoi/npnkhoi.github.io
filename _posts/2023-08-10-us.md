*Arrived at DFW airport in the morning*

I have moved to the US! Initial thoughts:
- My departure from home
  - I feel blessed to be loved by many loved ones, some very deeply.
  - My mom cried for me. It must have been hard to send her (good!) boy to such a complex country as the US.
  - I got a bit mindless during peparation, forgetting two things but luckily got covered by nice people (one by the Vietnam airlines staff, one by my cousins).
- Flight: uneventful, but uncomfortable middle seats.
- New life
  - Legal aspects: How to not get into trouble here?
  - Travelling: bike or walk in the first few months? Plan to learn to drive car
  - Academics:
    - Should block 10+ hours to do some familirization for my research.
