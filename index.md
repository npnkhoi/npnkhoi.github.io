Xin chào! I am Khoi, a doctoral student in the Human Language Technology Research Institute, University of Texas at Dallas. I am working on **computational meme processing** with [Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). 

<!--In the past, I worked with [Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) on Monte Carlo Tree Search.-->
I worked on Machine Learning projects at various companies. I was a summer intern at [Solano Energy](https://solano.energy/) (computer vision), [Koidra Tech](https://www.koidra.ai/) (symbolic regression),  and [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/rips2022/) (NLP). I will be joining [GE Aerospace](https://www.geaerospace.com/) next summer.

Before going into ML research, I also interned in product management and software engineering at [Holistics](https://www.holistics.io/). I am the author of [OneSchedule](https://npnkhoi.github.io/oneschedule/), a course planning website used by *many* students at Fulbright University Vietnam.
In a further past, I was competiting in Competitive Programming at national and regional level ([CodeForces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/pazabol), [press](https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-students-win-bronze-medal-at-icpc-asia-can-tho-regional-contest/)).
