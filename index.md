Xin chào! I am Khoi, a doctoral student in the Human Language Technology Research Institute, University of Texas at Dallas, supervised by Professor [Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). 

I work on **vision-language reasoning**. Specifically, my research explores meme processing as a structured and controlled environment to push the boundaries of machine's vision-language perception, reasoning, and generation in real-world contexts. 

<!--In the past, I worked with [Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) on Monte Carlo Tree Search.-->
Outside academia, I have had experiences realizing ML research into actual systems. Those experiences were done at [Solano Energy](https://solano.energy/), [Koidra Tech](https://www.koidra.ai/), and [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/rips2022/). Before going into ML research, I was an intern at [Holistics](https://www.holistics.io/), serving as both a product analyst and a frontend engineer. I am also the author of [OneSchedule](https://npnkhoi.github.io/oneschedule/), a course planning website used by *many* students at Fulbright University Vietnam.

In a further past, I was competiting in Competitive Programming at national and regional level ([CodeForces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/pazabol), [press](https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-students-win-bronze-medal-at-icpc-asia-can-tho-regional-contest/)). Back then, I had a wonderful time as an undergrad in the inaugural cohort of Fulbright University Vietnam, the first liberal arts university in my home country.

In my freetime, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, [meditating](https://dallasmeditationcenter.com/), and [blogging](https://npnkhoi.github.io/blog).
