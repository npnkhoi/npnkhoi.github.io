Xin chào! I am Khoi, a doctoral student in the Human Language Technology Research Institute, University of Texas at Dallas, supervised by Professor [Vincent Ng](https://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~vince/). I work on **vision-language reasoning**. Specifically, my research explores meme processing as a structured and controlled environment to push the boundaries of machine's vision-language perception, reasoning, and generation in real-world contexts. My research has been published in the most pretigious NLP conferences (ACL and EMNLP).

<!--In the past, I worked with [Raghuram Ramanujan](https://www.davidson.edu/people/raghu-ramanujan) on Monte Carlo Tree Search.-->
Beside research, I enjoy building practical systems, usually with machine learning. Some of the products I am proud of are:
- a requirement processing pipeline and a knowledge graph-based chatbot at GE Aerospace,
- an interactive map that shows roof area and potential solar energy of buildings in Vietnam at [Solano Energy](https://solano.energy/),
<!-- - a symbolic regressor package to learn greenhouse control rules at [Koidra Tech](https://www.koidra.ai/), -->
<!--- - methods to classify financial text messages by categories at [National University of Singapore](https://ims.nus.edu.sg/events/rips2022/), --->
- the version control feature of [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home), a 200K-MAU tool at [Holistics](https://www.holistics.io/),
- and [OneSchedule](https://npnkhoi.github.io/oneschedule/) -- a course planning website used by *many* students at my undergrad university.

My long term goal is to harness AI for Vietnam and for humanity.

In my freetime, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, [meditating](https://dallasmeditationcenter.com/), and [blogging](https://npnkhoi.github.io/blog).

## Fun facts
- I was a competitive programmer at national and regional level ([CodeForces profile](https://codeforces.com/profile/pazabol), [press](https://fulbright.edu.vn/fulbright-students-win-bronze-medal-at-icpc-asia-can-tho-regional-contest/)). 
- I graduated in the inaugural cohort of a brand new university called Fulbright University Vietnam. That was the best four years of my life.
